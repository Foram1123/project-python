## Week 08 

# Task 1:
1: Display Menu

Limitation
   â€¢	As of now, the display_menu() function doesn't handle user input or interact with any external services. It's purely for displaying the menu options to the     user. Therefore, limitations regarding data validation or assumptions of external service behaviors are not applicable to this function.
