# Task 9: Wildlife Module Get Surveys by Species

  Limitations : 
  
      •	The functions rely on external APIs which may have availability, rate limits, and performance limitations.
      •	The accuracy of data is dependent on the API's data, which may have inaccuracies or missing information.
      •	The filtering of incidental sightings assumes the presence of the SiteCode key in the survey data.

# Task 10 Sort : Done
